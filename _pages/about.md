Welcome,

I am a junior professor at the Université Caen Normandie and also conducting my research at the Grand Accélérateur National d'Ions Lourds (GANIL) in Caen, France.

I teach physics at the Undergraduate and Graduate levels at the UFR des Sciences of Université Caen Normandie. My research focuses on understanding organic chemistry in the solar system and beyond. More specifically, I study the different chemical steps starting from simple atoms and molecules leading to more complex organic molecules, in the gas phase and solid phase. The environments that I investigate consist of planetary atmospheres and surfaces in our solar system (Titan, Jupiter, Rhea, the early Earth, Pluto) and beyond (exoplanets, interstellar and circumstellar environments). I use a combination of experimental and modeling techniques to try and constrain the chemical composition and pathways leading to complex organic matter found in these cold environments.
