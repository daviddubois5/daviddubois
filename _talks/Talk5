Fougèrite, Alkaline Vents, and the Emergence of Life. Exploring the Alkaline Vent Theory, the 'inevitable journey to being', and Brittany

If Astrochemistry regulates the cosmic molecular abundance, Geochemistry is the regulation of a cosmos within a bigger cosmos. Organic molecules being ubiquitous still falls short of any remote detection of interplanetary and interstellar life. How then, can the interstellar "search for life" omit the geo-fundamentals that contribute eventually to the chemical inventory of life. Are so-called prebiotic molecules necessarily organic and biotic? Can a geochemical understanding of the emergence of life lead to a self-consistent paradigm that is unique to Earth? Here, we will address these questions through an examination of the Alkaline Vent Theory and overview some of the contradictions inherent to the study of prebiotic chemistry.
