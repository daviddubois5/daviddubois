The Cassini Mission has greatly improved our understanding of the dynamics and chemical processes occurring
in Titan's atmosphere. It has also provided us with more insight into the formation of the aerosols in the upper
atmospheric layers. However, the chemical composition and mechanisms leading to their formation were out of reach for the
instruments onboard Cassini. In this context, it is deemed necessary to apply and exploit laboratory simulations
to better understand the chemical reactivity occurring in the gas phase of Titan-like conditions. In the present
work, we report gas phase results obtained from a plasma discharge simulating the chemical processes in Titan's
ionosphere. We use the PAMPRE cold dusty plasma experiment with an N2eCH4 gaseous mixture under con-
trolled pressure and gas inﬂux. An internal cryogenic trap has been developed to accumulate the gas products
during their production and facilitate their detection. The cryogenic trap condenses the gas-phase precursors
while they are forming, so that aerosols are no longer observed during the 2 h plasma discharge. We focus mainly
on neutral products NH3, HCN, C2H2 and C2H4. The latter are identiﬁed and quantiﬁed by in situ mass spec-
trometry and infrared spectroscopy. We present here results from this experiment with mixing ratios of 90–10%
and 99–1% N2eCH4, covering the range of methane concentrations encountered in Titan's ionosphere. We also
detect in situ heavy molecules (C7). In particular, we show the role of ethylene and other volatiles as key solid-
phase precursors.
