The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Electron Spectrometer (ELS) instrument on board Cassini revealed an
unexpected abundance of negative ions above 950 km in Titan’s ionosphere. In situ measurements indicated the
presence of negatively charged particles with mass-over-charge ratios up to 13,800 u/q. At present, only a handful
of anions have been characterized by photochemical models, consisting mainly of CnH− carbon chain and Cn−1N−
cyano compounds (n = 2–6); their formation occurring essentially through proton abstraction from their parent
neutral molecules. However, numerous other species have yet to be detected and identiﬁed. Considering the
efﬁcient anion growth leading to compounds of thousands of u/q, it is necessary to better characterize the ﬁrst light
species. Here, we present new negative ion measurements with masses up to 200 u/q obtained in an N2:CH4 dusty
plasma discharge reproducing analogous conditions to Titan’s ionosphere. We perform a comparison with high-
altitude CAPS-ELS measurements near the top of Titan’s ionosphere from the T18 encounter. The main observed
peaks are in agreement with the observations. However, a number of other species (e.g., CNN−, CHNN−)
previously not considered suggests an abundance of N-bearing compounds, containing two or three nitrogen
atoms, consistent with certain adjacent doubly bonded nitrogen atoms found in tholins. These results suggest that
an N-rich incorporation into tholins may follow mechanisms including anion chemistry, further highlighting the
important role of negative ions in Titan’s aerosol growth.
